/*The bitwise right shift operation (low + high) >> 1 is faster than division by 2 (low + high) / 2.
This is because the right shift operation is a simpler bitwise operation at the hardware level, 
while division is computationally more expensive. In a test with 1,000,000 iterations,the right shift 
averaged about 0.079s, while the division took about 0.120s

n % 2 and n / 2 involve division â€” slower than bitwise operations.

n & 1 and n >> 1 are simple bitwise instructions â€” faster in practice.

time(for both): (O(log n)),
space: O(1)

but bitwise version is faster in real execution due to smaller constant factors.
